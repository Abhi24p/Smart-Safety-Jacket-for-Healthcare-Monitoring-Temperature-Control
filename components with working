1. ESP32 Controller (ESP32-DOWDQ6)

A powerful dual-core microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ADCs, multiple UART ports, and GPIOs used to control all sensors and communication modules.

2. GPS Module (NEO-6M)

A satellite-based positioning module that provides real-time latitude and longitude data for tracking and emergency location alerts.

3. Temperature Sensor (DS18B20)

A digital temperature sensor using the OneWire protocol to accurately measure body temperature with high precision.

4. Heart Rate Sensor (MAX30102 / Equivalent)

An optical sensor that uses infrared and red light to measure heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO₂) through photoplethysmography.

5. Gas Sensor (MQ135 / Equivalent)

Detects harmful gases such as CO₂, NH₃, NOx, and smoke; provides an analog output proportional to gas concentration for safety monitoring.

6. LCD Display (16×2 LCD)

A character display module that shows real-time data such as temperature, heart rate, gas levels, and system status using I²C communication.

7. Relay Board (Single-Channel)

An electrically controlled switch used to operate high-power devices like Peltier modules for automatic temperature regulation.

8. GSM Modem (SIM800L)

A GSM/GPRS communication module used to send emergency SMS alerts and transmit health data to a predefined mobile number.

9. Battery

Provides portable power to the system, especially required for the GSM module which needs stable 3.7–4.2V with high current capability.
