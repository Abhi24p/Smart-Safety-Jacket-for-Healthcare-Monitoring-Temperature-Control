The Smart Safety Jacket for Healthcare Monitoring & Temperature Control is an innovative wearable system designed to enhance personal safety and real-time health monitoring, particularly for individuals working in hazardous environments, elderly people, outdoor laborers, and emergency responders. The system integrates multiple biomedical and environmental sensors with an ESP32 microcontroller to monitor critical physiological parameters such as body temperature, heart rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO₂) using DS18B20 and MAX30102 sensors. Additionally, environmental factors like toxic gas concentration (via MQ135) and atmospheric pressure (via BMP180) are continuously monitored to detect potential health risks.

To ensure robust emergency response, the jacket features a GSM modem (SIM800L) that automatically sends SMS alerts containing current sensor data and GPS location coordinates via the NEO-6M module whenever abnormal conditions are detected. These conditions include high/low body temperature, unsafe gas levels, abnormal heart rate/SpO₂, or manual activation through the SOS button. A buzzer provides immediate audible alerts, while a 16×2 I²C LCD display offers continuous real-time feedback of all sensor readings.

A key functional feature of the system is its ability to regulate body temperature using a relay-controlled Peltier module, which activates automatically based on predefined thresholds. This ensures thermal comfort and reduces the risk of hypothermia or heat stress. The ESP32 coordinates all sensor communications using protocols such as I²C, UART, ADC, and OneWire, enabling seamless multi-sensor data acquisition and control.

The project showcases the effective integration of embedded systems, IoT communication, wireless alerting, and wearable technology to create a comprehensive safety solution. It emphasizes reliability, responsiveness, and real-time monitoring, offering a practical approach to improving human safety in environments where medical assistance may not be immediately available. With further development, the system can be expanded into fully networked IoT platforms, mobile applications, and industrial safety systems for large-scale deployment.
